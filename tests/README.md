# Hydra News Anonymity Tests

This directory contains tests to verify the anonymity features of the Hydra News system. These tests focus on the core cryptographic primitives in the C implementation that ensure source protection and content verification without compromising privacy.

## Test Components

The tests verify the following anonymity features:

1. **Superposition Creation**: Tests the creation of a quantum-inspired superposition state that allows for probabilistic encoding of information, a fundamental building block for privacy preservation.

2. **ZKP Generation & Verification**: Tests the generation and verification of zero-knowledge proofs, which allow a prover to demonstrate knowledge of a secret without revealing any information about the secret itself.

3. **ZKP Information Leakage**: Tests that the zero-knowledge proof system does not inadvertently leak information about the underlying secrets by comparing proofs of different secrets.

4. **Probabilistic Encoding**: Tests the encoding mechanism that introduces randomness to prevent deterministic analysis, essential for preserving privacy during verification.

5. **Logical Entanglement**: Tests the creation of cryptographic interdependencies between content elements to ensure tamper detection while maintaining privacy.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
# Navigate to the tests directory
cd /home/nick/hydra-news/tests

# Build and run the tests
make run
```

## Test Analysis

The tests verify that:

1. The system can create and manage superposition states correctly
2. Zero-knowledge proofs can be generated and verified
3. Proofs don't leak information about the secrets they prove
4. Probabilistic encoding provides randomness for privacy
5. Logical entanglement detects tampering while preserving privacy

## Security Considerations

These tests focus on the functional aspects of the anonymity features. In a production environment, additional tests would be needed for:

- Side-channel attack resistance
- Formal cryptographic security proofs
- Statistical analysis of information leakage
- Resistance to quantum computing attacks
- Performance under adversarial conditions

## Interpreting Results

A successful test run indicates that the core anonymity mechanisms are functioning as designed. However, comprehensive security would require additional cryptographic analysis and formal verification.
