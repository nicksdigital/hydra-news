# Post-Quantum Cryptography in Hydra News

This document explains the post-quantum cryptography implementation in the Hydra News system, using CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation and Falcon for digital signatures.

## Overview

The post-quantum cryptography implementation in Hydra News provides:

1. **Quantum-Resistant Key Exchange**: Using CRYSTALS-Kyber, a lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM)
2. **Quantum-Resistant Digital Signatures**: Using Falcon, a lattice-based signature scheme
3. **Enhanced Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Combining our Quantum-ZKP system with post-quantum signatures

These components are designed to ensure that the Hydra News system remains secure even against attacks from quantum computers.

## CRYSTALS-Kyber

CRYSTALS-Kyber is a lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) that is resistant to quantum attacks. It was selected by NIST as a post-quantum cryptography standard.

### Key Features

- **Lattice-Based Security**: Based on the Module Learning With Errors (MLWE) problem, which is believed to be resistant to quantum attacks
- **Efficient Implementation**: Provides good performance on a wide range of platforms
- **Configurable Security Levels**: Kyber-512 (NIST Level 1), Kyber-768 (NIST Level 3), Kyber-1024 (NIST Level 5)
- **Small Key and Ciphertext Sizes**: Compared to other post-quantum alternatives

### Implementation Details

Our implementation of Kyber provides:

- **Key Generation**: Creates a public and private key pair
- **Encapsulation**: Uses the public key to encapsulate a shared secret
- **Decapsulation**: Uses the private key to recover the shared secret

For Hydra News, we've chosen Kyber-768, which provides NIST Level 3 security (roughly equivalent to AES-192), offering a good balance between security and performance.

## Falcon

Falcon is a lattice-based signature scheme that is resistant to quantum attacks. It was also selected by NIST as a post-quantum cryptography standard.

### Key Features

- **Lattice-Based Security**: Based on NTRU lattices and Fast Fourier sampling
- **Small Signatures**: Compared to other post-quantum signature schemes
- **Efficient Verification**: Fast signature verification process
- **Configurable Security Levels**: Falcon-512 (NIST Level 1), Falcon-1024 (NIST Level 5)

### Implementation Details

Our implementation of Falcon provides:

- **Key Generation**: Creates a public and private key pair
- **Signing**: Uses the private key to sign a message
- **Verification**: Uses the public key to verify a signature

For Hydra News, we've chosen Falcon-512, which provides NIST Level 1 security (roughly equivalent to AES-128), as it offers excellent performance with sufficient security for our requirements.

## Cryptographic Adapter

The cryptographic adapter integrates post-quantum algorithms with the existing Quantum-ZKP system, providing a unified interface for all cryptographic operations.

### Features

- **Unified Key Management**: Manages different types of cryptographic keys (symmetric, Kyber, Falcon)
- **Key Rotation**: Support for key expiration and rotation
- **Hybrid Cryptography**: Option to combine classical and post-quantum algorithms for defense in depth
- **Enhanced Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Combines Quantum-ZKP with Falcon signatures

### API Overview

The adapter exposes the following main functions:

- `crypto_generate_key`: Generates cryptographic keys of various types
- `crypto_sign_message`: Signs messages using Falcon
- `crypto_verify_signature`: Verifies Falcon signatures
- `crypto_establish_key`: Establishes a shared key using Kyber
- `crypto_receive_key`: Recovers a shared key using Kyber
- `crypto_generate_zkproof`: Generates zero-knowledge proofs with post-quantum security
- `crypto_verify_zkproof`: Verifies zero-knowledge proofs with post-quantum security

## Security Considerations

### Key Management

- **Root Keys**: Should be stored in HSMs (Hardware Security Modules)
- **Intermediate Keys**: Stored in a secure key vault
- **Session Keys**: Generated on-demand using Kyber

### Hybrid Cryptography

For maximum security, we recommend enabling hybrid cryptography, which combines:

- Post-quantum algorithms (Kyber, Falcon)
- Classical algorithms (e.g., ECDH, Ed25519)

This provides defense in depth against both classical and quantum attacks.

### Forward Secrecy

The system implements forward secrecy by regularly rotating keys and generating new session keys for each communication session.

## Performance Implications

Post-quantum cryptography generally requires more computational resources than classical cryptography. Here are some considerations:

- **Kyber Key Exchange**: 2-3x slower than ECDH, with larger key sizes
- **Falcon Signatures**: 5-10x slower than Ed25519, but with competitive signature sizes
- **Memory Usage**: Requires more memory than classical algorithms

For most applications within Hydra News, the performance impact should be acceptable, especially with modern hardware.

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests for all post-quantum components:

- Basic functionality tests for Kyber and Falcon
- Integration tests for the cryptographic adapter
- Security tests to verify resistance to various attacks

Run the tests using:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/hydra-news/tests
make run-pq
```

## Future Work

- **Integration with Hardware Security Modules**: For storing root keys
- **Implementation of Key Rotation Policies**: Automated key rotation based on time or usage
- **Support for Other Post-Quantum Algorithms**: As standards evolve
- **Performance Optimizations**: Especially for resource-constrained environments
