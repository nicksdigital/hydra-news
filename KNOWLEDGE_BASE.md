# Hydra News - Knowledge Base

## Project Overview

Hydra News is an untamperable news verification system designed to combat misinformation and protect news sources while ensuring content integrity. The system leverages quantum-inspired zero-knowledge proofs, cryptographic techniques, and distributed consensus to create a resilient, privacy-preserving news platform.

## Core Concepts

### Quantum Zero-Knowledge Proof (Quantum-ZKP)

Based on the research paper "Quantum Zero-Knowledge Proof (Quantum-ZKP) and Its Applications in Secure Distributed Systems", this approach draws inspiration from quantum computing principles:

1. **Probabilistic Encoding (Superposition)**: Encodes potential solutions probabilistically, revealing only aggregated statistical properties.
2. **Logical Entanglement**: Creates interdependencies between proof elements to ensure tamper-resistance.
3. **Probabilistic Verification**: Introduces randomness into the verification process to enhance security.

### Address Generation with Geolocation Verification

Implements a system for verifying source locations while preserving privacy:

1. **BLAKE3 Hashing**: Efficient cryptographic hashing for address generation.
2. **Geolocation ZKP**: Verifies a source's location without revealing exact coordinates.
3. **Privacy-Preserving Location Validation**: Allows verification of a reporter's location claims without compromising their safety.

### Layered Matrix and Vector System

Provides a robust approach for secure, multi-dimensional data handling:

1. **Layered Vectors**: Multi-dimensional representation of data with different security layers.
2. **Matrix Construction**: Creates interactions between specific layers of vectors.
3. **Secret Sharing**: Distributes data across multiple parties for fault tolerance and security.
