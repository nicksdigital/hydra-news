## Risks and Challenges

1. **Post-Quantum Security Maturity**: The post-quantum algorithms are still evolving and may need updates as standards continue to develop.

2. **Integration Complexity**: As the system grows more complex, ensuring correct integration between components becomes more challenging.

3. **Performance Considerations**: Post-quantum cryptographic operations are more computationally intensive than classical algorithms, which may impact system performance under load.

4. **Security vs. Usability**: Maintaining a balance between strong security features and user-friendly interfaces remains a challenge.

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on API Security**: Before expanding features, ensure the current functionality is secure by implementing the API security enhancements.

2. **Implement Comprehensive Testing**: Develop automated testing to ensure reliability and security as the system grows.

3. **Document Architecture**: Create detailed architecture documentation to facilitate maintenance and future development.

4. **Conduct External Security Audit**: Once the core security features are complete, consider an external security audit to validate the design and implementation.

5. **Begin Performance Testing**: Start stress testing the system to identify performance bottlenecks, particularly related to cryptographic operations.

## Conclusion

The project has made significant progress in implementing the core security features and infrastructure. The key management system, forward secrecy, and database integration provide a solid foundation for the next phase of development. By focusing on the API security and testing next, we can ensure the system remains secure and reliable as it grows.
