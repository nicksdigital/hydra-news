# Hydra News

## Untamperable News Verification System

Hydra News is a decentralized system for verifying news content while protecting sources and ensuring data integrity through quantum-inspired cryptography and distributed consensus.

## Core Features

- **Source Protection**: Zero-knowledge proof identity verification for journalists and whistleblowers
- **Content Integrity**: Logical entanglement to create tamper-evident content
- **Distributed Verification**: Byzantine fault-tolerant network to resist attacks and censorship
- **Privacy-Preserving Location**: Geolocation verification without revealing exact coordinates

## System Architecture

The Hydra News system consists of the following key components:

### 1. Core Cryptographic Layer (C)

The foundation of the system is built with C code that implements:

- **Quantum Zero-Knowledge Proofs (QZKP)**: A cryptographic approach that enables verification without revealing sensitive information
- **Logical Entanglement**: Creates cryptographic interdependencies between content elements to ensure tamper resistance

### 2. Distributed Consensus Network (Go)

The Go implementation handles:

- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Ensures system integrity even with potentially malicious nodes
- **Identity Verification**: Protects source anonymity while validating authenticity
- **API Layer**: RESTful API for interacting with the system

### 3. Content Processing Engine (Python)

The Python services provide:

- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies key entities in news content
- **Claim Detection**: Extracts and verifies factual claims
- **Cross-Reference Verification**: Compares content with multiple sources

### 4. User Interface (TypeScript/React)

The frontend displays:

- **Verification Status**: Visual indicators of content verification level
- **Entity Highlighting**: Interactive visualization of identified entities
- **Claim Analysis**: Breakdown of verified and disputed claims

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+ 
- GCC/Clang compiler
- OpenSSL development libraries

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hydra-news.git
cd hydra-news

# Build and start all services
./scripts/start_dev.sh
```

This will:
1. Compile the C cryptographic primitives
2. Build the Go API service
3. Start the Python content processor
4. Launch the TypeScript frontend

## API Documentation

### Content Submission

```
POST /api/content/submit
```

Submit new content for processing and verification.

### Content Verification

```
POST /api/content/verify
```

Verify content against other sources.

### Content Retrieval

```
GET /api/content/{hash}
```

Retrieve content and its verification status by hash.

## Security Features

### Source Protection

Sources are protected through:

1. **Zero-Knowledge Identity Verification**: Verifies source credentials without exposing identity
2. **Geolocation Verification**: Confirms location claims while obscuring exact coordinates
3. **Anonymous Credential System**: Issues non-transferable credentials to verified sources

### Content Integrity

Content is protected through:

1. **Logical Entanglement**: Creates cryptographic interdependencies to prevent tampering
2. **Distributed Verification**: Multiple nodes verify content independently
3. **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: System remains secure even if some nodes are compromised

## Research Foundation

This project is based on research papers:

1. Quantum Zero-Knowledge Proof (Quantum-ZKP)
2. Address Generation with Geolocation-Verified ZKPs
3. Layered Matrix and Vector System for Secure Distributed Computation
