# Hydra News

## Untamperable News Verification System

Hydra News is a decentralized system for verifying news content while protecting sources and ensuring data integrity through quantum-inspired cryptography and distributed consensus.

## Core Features

- **Source Protection**: Zero-knowledge proof identity verification for journalists and whistleblowers
- **Content Integrity**: Logical entanglement to create tamper-evident content
- **Distributed Verification**: Byzantine fault-tolerant network to resist attacks and censorship
- **Privacy-Preserving Location**: Geolocation verification without revealing exact coordinates

## Technologies

- **C**: Core cryptographic primitives and logical entanglement
- **Go**: Distributed consensus and identity verification
- **Python**: Content processing and natural language analysis
- **TypeScript**: User interface and visualization

## Architecture

![Hydra News Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

The system consists of four primary layers:

1. **Source Authentication & Protection Layer**: Verifies sources without exposing identities
2. **Content Processing & Validation Layer**: Processes and entangles content for verification
3. **Distributed Verification Network**: Achieves consensus across multiple validation nodes 
4. **Public Distribution Layer**: Provides access to verified content with integrity proofs
