# Hydra News

## Untamperable News Verification System

Hydra News is a decentralized system for verifying news content while protecting sources and ensuring data integrity through quantum-inspired cryptography and distributed consensus.

## Core Features

- **Source Protection**: Zero-knowledge proof identity verification for journalists and whistleblowers
- **Content Integrity**: Logical entanglement to create tamper-evident content
- **Distributed Verification**: Byzantine fault-tolerant network to resist attacks and censorship
- **Privacy-Preserving Location**: Geolocation verification without revealing exact coordinates
- **Forward Secrecy**: Key rotation mechanisms prevent decryption of past communications
- **Persistent Storage**: SQLite-based database with automatic backups and data integrity

## System Architecture

The Hydra News system consists of the following key components:

### 1. Core Cryptographic Layer (C)

The foundation of the system is built with C code that implements:

- **Quantum Zero-Knowledge Proofs (QZKP)**: A cryptographic approach that enables verification without revealing sensitive information
- **Logical Entanglement**: Creates cryptographic interdependencies between content elements to ensure tamper resistance
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Uses NIST-standardized algorithms to protect against quantum computing attacks:
  - **CRYSTALS-Kyber**: Key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) for secure key exchange
  - **Falcon**: Digital signature scheme for message authentication
  - **Crypto Adapter**: Integration layer that combines classical and post-quantum algorithms
- **Key Management**: Secure key lifecycle with rotation and forward secrecy:
  - Automated key rotation to limit key exposure
  - Forward secrecy to protect past communications
  - Secure key backup and recovery procedures
  - Hierarchical key structure (root, intermediate, session keys)

### 2. Distributed Consensus Network (Go)

The Go implementation handles:

- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Ensures system integrity even with potentially malicious nodes
- **Identity Verification**: Protects source anonymity while validating authenticity
- **API Layer**: RESTful API for interacting with the system
- **Secure Node Bootstrapping**: Privacy-preserving secure node discovery and joining
- **Node Reputation System**: Trust-based node evaluation for enhanced security
- **Network Recovery**: Mechanisms to handle network partitions and node failures
- **Database Integration**: Persistent storage with data integrity and backup features

### 3. Content Processing Engine (Python)

The Python services provide:

- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies key entities in news content
- **Claim Detection**: Extracts and verifies factual claims
- **Cross-Reference Verification**: Compares content with multiple sources

### 4. User Interface (TypeScript/React)

The frontend displays:

- **Verification Status**: Visual indicators of content verification level
- **Entity Highlighting**: Interactive visualization of identified entities
- **Claim Analysis**: Breakdown of verified and disputed claims

## Post-Quantum Cryptographic Architecture

The Hydra News system implements NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to ensure long-term security against attacks from both classical and quantum computers.

### Key Components

1. **CRYSTALS-Kyber** - A module lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) used for:
   - Secure key exchange between system components
   - Forward-secret communication channels
   - Protecting sensitive data at rest

2. **Falcon** - A hash-based signature scheme using NTRU lattices for:
   - Digital signatures with post-quantum security
   - Source authentication
   - Content verification and integrity checking

3. **Crypto Adapter** - Integration layer that:
   - Combines classical and post-quantum algorithms for hybrid security
   - Provides a consistent API for cryptographic operations
   - Enables zero-knowledge proofs with post-quantum security

4. **Key Management System** - Secure key lifecycle management:
   - HashiCorp Vault integration for secure key storage
   - Automated key rotation policies based on key type and usage
   - Forward secrecy implementation for ephemeral communications
   - Hierarchical key structure with different security levels
   - Secure backup and recovery procedures

### Security Benefits

- **Quantum Resistance**: Protects against attacks using Shor's algorithm on quantum computers
- **Strong Classical Security**: Maintains high security against traditional attacks
- **Defense in Depth**: Hybrid approach combines multiple cryptographic techniques
- **Future-Proof**: Designed to accommodate cryptographic agility as standards evolve
- **Forward Secrecy**: Past communications remain secure even if keys are later compromised
- **Key Rotation**: Limits the impact of potential key compromise

## Database Integration

The system includes a robust SQLite-based database implementation for persistent storage:

- **Thread-safe operations**: All database interactions are properly synchronized
- **Comprehensive schema**: Support for all system entities including content, claims, verifications, etc.
- **Automatic backups**: Configurable backup system to prevent data loss
- **Transaction support**: Ensures data integrity during complex operations
- **Modular design**: Separated by domain for maintainability
- **Data retention policies**: Configurable policies for data lifecycle management

## Security Features

### Source Protection

Sources are protected through:

1. **Zero-Knowledge Identity Verification**: Verifies source credentials without exposing identity
2. **Geolocation Verification**: Confirms location claims while obscuring exact coordinates
3. **Anonymous Credential System**: Issues non-transferable credentials to verified sources
4. **Post-Quantum Signatures**: Uses Falcon signatures to protect identities against attacks using quantum computers
5. **Forward Secrecy**: Ensures past communications remain secure even if keys are compromised

### Content Integrity

Content is protected through:

1. **Logical Entanglement**: Creates cryptographic interdependencies to prevent tampering
2. **Distributed Verification**: Multiple nodes verify content independently
3. **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: System remains secure even if some nodes are compromised
4. **Quantum-Resistant Encryption**: Employs CRYSTALS-Kyber for key exchange to protect content from future quantum computing attacks
5. **Persistent Storage**: Secure database with integrity checks and automatic backups

### Post-Quantum Security

The system is designed to resist attacks from both classical and quantum computers:

1. **NIST-Standardized Algorithms**: Uses cryptographic algorithms selected through NIST's Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization process
2. **Hybrid Cryptography**: Combines traditional and post-quantum algorithms for defense in depth
3. **Forward Secrecy**: Ensures that compromised keys cannot be used to decrypt previously captured data
